## Python

This portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects demonstrating expertise in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), neural networks, and exploratory data analysis (EDA). From sentiment classification using Naive Bayes and Random Forest models to predicting client behaviors with neural networks, each project integrates advanced techniques in data preprocessing, class balancing, and model evaluation. The work reflects a strong commitment to extracting actionable insights and delivering high-impact solutions across various domains, with a particular emphasis on NLP applications.

| Project Link | Project Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|
| ⭐ [Sentiment Classification of Yelp Reviews](https://github.com/juantrillo1997/Sentiment-Classification-of-Yelp-Reviews) | Expanded upon a course project to develop an integrated model predicting all star ratings (1-5) for Yelp reviews. Implemented various machine learning techniques, NLP, including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SMOTE, and class weighting to address class imbalance and improve accuracy. Evaluated models with precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. | pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, plotly |
| 🏦 [Bank Client Term Deposit Prediction](https://github.com/juantrillo1997/Bank-Client-Term-Deposit-Prediction) | Developed a neural network model to predict bank clients' likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit based on client attributes and campaign factors. Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance through downsampling. Evaluated the model's effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score. | pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow |
| 🛒 [Online Retail Dataset Analysis Report](https://github.com/juantrillo1997/Online-Retail-Dataset-Analysis-Report) | Conducted exploratory data analysis on transactional data from an online retail store to identify sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. Employed a combination of classical statistical methods (such as IQR) and machine learning techniques (like Isolation Forest) to detect outliers and anomalies, providing actionable insights to optimize store operations and enhance customer satisfaction. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |
