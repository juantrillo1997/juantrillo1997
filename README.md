# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

## About Me

I am a Ph.D. in Mathematics with a European mention, in light of three months of research in Germany, conducted in a fully English-speaking environment. Unlike many recent graduates in the fields of Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, my Ph.D. training provides me with deep expertise in mathematics, statistics, and programming. I believe this is my strong point, positioning me as a unique asset in a landscape often dominated by conventional and routine approaches to problems that require more critical thinking and innovative solutions, i.e., 'thinking outside the box.'

In my next role, I aim to go beyond typical analyses and am eager to apply my knowledge and broaden my perspective in Data Analysis and Machine Learning.
